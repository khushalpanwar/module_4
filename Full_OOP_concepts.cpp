/* what is OOP? List OOP concepts.

==> Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm 
    based on the concept of "objects", which can contain
    data and code:
    data in the form of fields, and code,in the form of 
    procedures. A common features of objects in that 
    procedures are attached to them and can access and
    modify the object's data fields.
    
    1. Inheritance==> In object-oriented programming, inheritance
        is a mechanism where programmers can derive a class from
        another class. This concept of OOP can be useful in giving
        custom logic to existing frameworks and in declaring different
        exceptions. Inheritance also allows programmers to reuse previously
        writtenf codes. This removes the burden of writing the same codes again,
        as programmers can make a derived class inherit the property of its
        parent class. For example, one can create two classes and name them
        hatchback and sedan inherited from the parent class car.
        
        There are following five different variations in inheritance in OOP languages:
        
        * Single inheritance: It is the simplest form of inheritance where a class 
          inherits only one parent class. Single inheritance enables code reusanility 
          and adds new features to the existing class.
        
        * Multiple inheritance: When a class inherits more than one parent class,it
          becomes multiple inheritance. As the child class inherits properties from
          different parent classes, it has access to all of its objects. It is the 
          diffrent from a single inheritance property, as it allows an object or class
          to inherit from more than one object or class.
        
        * Multilevel inheritance: When one class inherits properties from a derived
          class, it is multilevel inheritance. For example, class A extends class B
          and class B extend class C.
          
        * Hierarchical inheritance: In this variation of inheritance, the different 
		  child classes inherit a single parent class. For example, a parent class C 
		  can have three subclasses,D,E and F.
		  
		* Hybrid inheritance: If there is a combination of more than one type of 
		  inheritance, it is a hybrid inheritance. It can be a combination of simple,
		  multiple and hierarchical inheritances.
		  
		  
	2. Polymorphism ==>
	   Polymorphism is the core concept of the object-oriented programming language
	   that allows programmers to build logical codes. In this concept of OOP,
	   programmers can access objects of different types through the same interface 
	   where each type provides its own implementation of the interface.
	   
	   The following two types of Polymorphism are useful in OOP.
	   
		* Compile-time Polymorphism : Also called static binding Polymorphism, it means
	     binding occurs at compile time. Method overloading is an example of compile-time
	     Polymorphism. It allows programmers to use objects of the same name while their 
	     parameters can be different.
	     
		* Runtime Polymorphism: Runtime Polymorphism involves dynamic binding. Method 
		overriding is an example of runtime Polymorphism. In this process, an object binds
		with the functionality at the run time.
		
	3. Abstraction ==>
	   This is the core concept of OOP that allows programmers to be abstract or pick out
	   common features of the objects and procedures. In other words, abstraction means hiding
	   intenal details and showing functionality. The primary aim of programmers behind
	   using abstraction in to handle complexity by irrelevant details. It is an extension of 
	   encapsulation.
	   
	   For example, a customer may only use a few selections of tools petrol,accelerator,clutch,
	   brake,wheel,and odometer of a motorcycle. Most of the engineering work remains inconsequential
	   to the customer till it continues to function properly. To make a motorcycle run, a lot of 
	   pieces and parts work together. Letting the details and information get exposed to the 
	   customers can be a dangerous distraction. This is the concept of abstraction that is useful in 
	   many fields of engineering.
	   
	4. Encapsulation ==>
		It is the basic concept of OOP that helps programmers to bind the data and functions together 
		that manipulate the data. Encapsulation of data leads to the OOP concept of data hiding and 
		keeps the safe from outside attention. One of the common examples of encapsulation is calculator,
		as anybody using a calculator understands its functions, but may not require an understanding of 
		how it works inside. Encapsulation can help in hiding irrelevant details from the outside world 
		and highlight the necessary characteristics of a class to the users.
